## FAQs

#### Why not supported MacOS?

The [vibrancy](https://github.com/EYHN/vscode-vibrancy) plugin has been implemented without the need to do duplicates. And the effect of MacOS is different from Windows.

#### Why make this plugin?

The Acrylic effect on Windows has a sliding delay, but there is no problem with BlurBehind and TransparentGradient, so I made a plugin that can choose the effect.
